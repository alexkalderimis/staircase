    "This tool allows users to start a new structured query across the database. It lets the user choose a data type to search for (divided into the primary and secondary data-types included in the data-warehouse) and optionally also add a simple filter. When the parameters are changed, a counter indicating the number of rows this query will return is updated.",
    "When the query is appropriately defined, the user can click on the view table button to display the results of this query in a dynamic results table. The table will allow the user to further explore the results set by specifying the columns, further configuring the filters and proceeding to further steps with the data."
